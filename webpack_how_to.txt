for those watching in 2018, Brad is using webpack 3.8.1 in this video, current version is 4.1.1, that comes with webpack-cli beeing its own npm package, and a few changes in webpack.config.js:
1- change "loaders", to "rules" https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49203841/webpack-4-1-1-configuration-module-has-an-unknown-property-loaders
2- I did not figure out the reason for this working, but remove query field from loaders object in config, if you leave it you will get ELIFECYCLE error msg and no build folder 
3- as it is said in console msg, when using webpack-dev-server put your .html file in dist folder, or it wont work

as for polyfills https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/polyfill/


npm init
npm install --save-dev webpack 
webpack-dev-server 
babel-core 
babel-loader 
babel-preset-env
npm install --save-dev babel-polyfill


Edit package.json and add line below:
"scripts":{
    "build": "webpack"
}

Add webpack.config.js and write as an existing file
in this project.



const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.1.js',
  mode: 'development',
  output: {
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
    filename: 'bundle.js'
  },
  devServer: {
    contentBase: path.join(__dirname, "dist"),
    compress: true,
    port: 9000
  },
  watch:true
};

---------------
 npm run build
 npm start
